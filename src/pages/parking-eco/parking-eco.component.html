    <h3 class="font-bold text-5xl">TRUCK PARKING ECOSYSTEM</h3>
    <p>
      Every year 4 lakh new trucks getting into the logistics market seeking for
      parking space. The estimated value of the goods carried by the trucks on
      Indian roads is $ 200Bn. Over 57,000 truck crashes and 15,000 drivers are
      killed on road accidents every year. Truck drivers often have to try
      several lots before they can find somewhere to park. The result is
      frustration, fatigue, improper sleep, robbery, insecurity over vehicle
      protection.
    </p>

      parking availability information systems, parking reservation systems, and
      predictive parking algorithms, to truckers/drivers to more efficiently
      plan their trips and find suitable parking options along the way. Also
      improving the overall management and utilization of truck parking
      resources, reducing congestion and improving safety for everyone on the
      road.

      need to meet the increasing demands of the trucking industry and improve
